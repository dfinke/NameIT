function address {
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
    The function is intended to generate a random address

    .DESCRIPTION
    As per the original, this function generates a random street address by default. This version is enhanced to provide a more realistic street address
    with a real country and city, as well as a more realistic street names made of words and values from other generators instead of a random string value.

    .PARAMETER DataSet
    Controls what data is returned. Accepts two options as outlined below.

        - Base: Most closely mimics the original functionality, in that only the street portion of the address is returned
        - Full: Returns all address elements, with the exception of Geolocation, which is only included if the IncludeGeo switch is also used

    .PARAMETER CountryCode
    Limit generated item to a specific country by supplying the associated two-character country code. 

    .PARAMETER IncludeGeo
    Includes the latitude and longitude details of the city, if available.

    Note: This will NOT be the geolocation for the street address as the street will be entirely random and will not likely exist

    .PARAMETER AsObject
    Specifying this switch will cause a custom PSObject to be returned instead of just a simple string value, making it easier
    to reuse for other generator templates without needing to extend the functionality of this one.
